If you are reading this after launching AudioMog GUI and thinking "Whoa! I can't read anything! Too small!" then you've found the solution.

To switch to High-DPI mode, you will have to do so manually for now. I hope to add a simple option for it when I add the toolbar.

For now:
**Backup the files mentioned below**
Replace the existing MogGUI.glade file with the one from the HighDPI folder.
Replace AMlogo.png in the Icons directory with the one from the HighDPI folder.
